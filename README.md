# Frontend Mentor - Sunnyside agency landing page solution

This is a solution to the [Sunnyside agency landing page challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/sunnyside-agency-landing-page-7yVs3B6ef).

# note

As this was done mainly to practise, the exactness of some details are left out such as fontsize, letter-spacing, or other details as such. Hover effects were omitted with hover state being at all times.
